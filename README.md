## Motion Detection

Build your own low cost security cam!

This is the backend, which is based on the python raspberry pi camera module interface [picamera](https://github.com/waveform80/picamera), for the coming soon iOS-App.
   
Please feel free to change and improve the code, this is my first python project.

### Features
- records in 1080p with low cpu usage
- records also a few seconds before the motion was detected
- creates a thumbnail of the event as preview for the video
- define areas which don't need to checked (e.g. a tree in the wind)
- optional nightmode with lower fps but much brighter videos 
- live view

### Requirements
- Raspberry Pi
- Camera Module

### Installation

Instructions for an installation on Raspbian Jessie Lite 

- **Install dependencies** 

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-imaging gpac libav-tools imagemagick git python-dev python-pip
sudo pip install pyephem numpy picamera
```

- **Clone this repository**

```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/dneunkirch/motiondetection.git /etc/motiondetection
```

- **Create a symlink for the init script**

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/motiondetection/scripts/startup.sh /etc/init.d/motiondetection
```

- **Register the init script**

```bash
sudo update-rc.d motiondetection defaults
```

Now you're able to start/stop the motion detection with the command `sudo service motiondetection {start|stop}`. The motion detection starts also automatically at startup.

- **Configuration-File**

`/etc/motiondetection/python/config.ini` 

---

###URLs

The port (default: `8080`) and credentials (default: `username`, `password`) can be changed in the config file. You're able to add multiple users in the `users` section or even turn the basic authorization off.
  
- **Live MJPEG stream `/live` or `/live.mjpeg`**
- **Current live picture `/live.jpg`**
- **Exclude areas from motion detection `/blacklist`**
- **Delete an event `/delete?file=filename_of_video.mp4`**

    A GET request to this endpoint deletes the given video including his preview image.
- **Captured Videos `/events`**

    Returns an array of all captured videos as following object:

    ```js
    {
      "date": "yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss",    // date of video
      "video": "/events/video.mp4",     // path to video
      "poster": "/events/preview.jpg",  // path to preview image
      "size": 1000000,                  // size of video in bytes
      "duration": 10                    // duration of video in seconds
    }
    ```

####For testing and debugging

- **Fake Motion `/force_motion`**
- **Stop Faking Motion `/stop_force_motion`**
- **Activate Daymode `/daymode`**
- **Activate Nightmode `/nightmode`**

    Works only if `night_mode_allowed` in the config is `True`

####Todo's
- [ ] submit iOS-App to App-Store
- [ ] create a web-App
- [ ] write tests
